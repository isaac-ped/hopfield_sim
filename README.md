# Hopfield Network Simulation

* Install dependencies with ``conda env create -f conda_environment.txt``
* Start with ``python hopfield.py``

##NB: 
* Importing images might not work as specified in the settings menu. 
    However, you can definitely add new images to the `images` folder,
    and they will be added to the image library on startup.
